                Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
                intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page
                of plain text to complex Web-based Internet applications (Web apps), electronic businesses, and social
                network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may
                include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side
                scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

                Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
                sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make
                content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

                For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web
                developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller
                organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to
                related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may
                be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There
                are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack
                developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser,
                while back-end developers deal with the servers.
                For any business, a website matters more than anything, when it comes to reaching out to customers
                online. A website is the representation of the business online. These days, every business realizes the
                need for having a website and are putting in efforts to design and develop the best site for taking
                their products or services online. This is where we can see a great deal of scope for web development
                and design.

                With the tremendous progress in the launch of websites, people who can create exemplary designs and
                platforms for their online presence is what businesses are searching for. Web developers and designers
                are bringing in all the best of their technical expertise and skills to develop and unique design
                websites that are and capable of pulling the crowd.

                Most web developers and designers are familiar with the latest tools, techniques, technologies, and
                frameworks that will help them get beautiful sites up in a short span of time. The development time of
                websites has come down with the agile technologies that make development easier. Here, we will cover the
                scope and future of web development.
                <h4 style="margin: 6px 0px;">Security considerations:</h4>
                Web development takes into account many security considerations, such as data entry error checking
                through forms, filtering output, and encryption. Malicious practices such as SQL injection can be
                executed by users with ill intent yet with only primitive knowledge of Web development as a whole.
                Scripts can be used to exploit Web sites by granting unauthorized access to malicious users that try to
                collect information such as email addresses, passwords and protected content like credit card numbers.

                Some of this is dependent on the server environment on which the scripting language, such as ASP, JSP,
                PHP, Python, Perl or Ruby is running, and therefore is not necessarily down to the Web developer
                themselves to maintain. However, stringent testing of Web applications before public release is
                encouraged to prevent such exploits from occurring. If some contact form is provided on a Web site it
                should include a captcha field in it which prevents computer programs from automatically filling forms
                and also mail spamming.

                Keeping a Web server safe from intrusion is often called Server Port Hardening. Many technologies come
                into play to keep information on the Internet safe when it is transmitted from one location to another.
                For instance TLS certificates (or "SSL certificates") are issued by certificate authorities to help
                prevent Internet fraud. Many developers often employ different forms of encryption when transmitting and
                storing sensitive information. A basic understanding of information technology security concerns is
                often part of a Web developer's knowledge.

                Because new security holes are found in Web applications even after testing and launch, security patch
                updates are frequent for widely used applications. It is often the job of Web developers to keep
                applications up to date as security patches are released and new security concerns are discovered.
